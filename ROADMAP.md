## ❌ Explicitly Rejected Features

Features that don't align with the app's vision:

- ❌ **User Accounts** - Backend overhead, not needed
- ❌ **Social Features** - Changes app nature
- ❌ **Gamification** - Cheapens experience
- ❌ **Video Generation** - Too slow, too expensive
- ❌ **VR/AR Mode** - Complexity doesn't match value
- ❌ **Real-time Collaboration** - Unnecessary complexity
- ❌ **Blockchain/NFTs** - No

## Implementation Notes

### Architecture Decisions
- **Storage**: localStorage for small data, IndexedDB for images
- **State**: Extend ChronoscopeContext, avoid prop drilling
- **AI**: Gemini 3 Pro Image for generation, Gemini 2.0 Flash for chat
- **Caching**: Aggressive caching for cost optimization

### Cost Management
- Time-lapse: Use 1K for scrubbing, 2K for final
- Chat: Gemini Flash is ~$0.0001 per message
- Image generation: ~$0.01-0.05 per image
- Target: < $0.10 per user per session

### Performance Targets
- Image generation: < 60s at p95
- Chat response: < 3s
- Time-lapse frame: < 45s average
- UI interactions: < 100ms
